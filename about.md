This course will cover the basic techniques which underlie the computational mathematical techniques in common use in the Earth sciences. It will provide an overview of the capabilities and limitations of scientific computation including the concepts of error and conditioning. The course will cover techniques applicable to both observational data and simulation and will have an emphasis on the practical implementation of the methods studied in the Python programming language.

The lectures notes are written in [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). This is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can combine code execution, text, mathematics, plots and rich media into a single document. The notes are based on the [notes by David Ham](https://bitbucket.org/David_Ham/numerical_methods_1) and the course text book "Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python 3" by Jaan Kiusalaas.
