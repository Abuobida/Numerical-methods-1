Welcome to the 2.18 Programming for Geoscientists class test 2014.

Just like all the lectures the exam is written in IPython notebook format. Follow all the instructions on the test notebook carefully. In particular, save your work regularly and make sure you save and send me your iPython notebook file at the end of the exam.

If you have any difficulty please put up a red sticky note as usual. When you are ready to email your completed test, please put up a green sticky. This should be the only time you open your email during the course of the test.
