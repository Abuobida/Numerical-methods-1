Just like all the lectures the exam is written in IPython notebook format. You should make sure you can add cells to write your solutions.

You will also need to download the data file
[hpip_yakutsk_borehole_data.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/data/hpip_yakutsk_borehole_data.txt)

If you are having difficulty opening the file in Anaconda or Canopy then please revise the guidelines in week 1 or call on one of the GTA's.
