The lecture is written in IPython notebook format. You can view it directly
and download it using
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.githubusercontent.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-5-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb)

If you are having difficulty opening the file in Anaconda or Canopy then please
revise the guidelines in week 1 or call on one of the GTA's.
