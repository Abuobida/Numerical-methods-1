The plan today is to finish the discussion from the last lecture on strings and writing to file. In the time remaining we will cover the material on the python [class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)) from lecture 6 below. However, as we will not be able to spend too much time on this item, it will not appear on the exam. We are only interested in you understanding enough to support self learning.

As usual the lecture is written in IPython notebook format. You can view it directly
and download it using
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.githubusercontent.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-6-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb)

If you are having difficulty opening the file in Anaconda or Canopy then please
revise the guidelines in week 1 or call on one of the GTA's.
