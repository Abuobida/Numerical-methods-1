The lecture is written in IPython notebook format. You can view it directly using
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-2-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true) or [download the notebook here](http://raw.github.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-2-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb?raw=true) (Note: you may need to right-click and use *Save Link As...*).

If you are having difficulty opening the file in Anaconda or Canopy then please revise the guidelines in week 1 or call on one of the GTA's.

This lecture does have quite a bit of material in it. So we are going to monitor progress closely and may split it across 2 weeks depending on how we get on.
