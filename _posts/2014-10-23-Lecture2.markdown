The lecture is written in IPython notebook format. You can view it directly
using
[nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/url/raw.githubusercontent.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-2-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb)
or [download the notebook
here](http://raw.githubusercontent.com/ggorman/Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists/master/notebook/Lecture-2-Introduction-to-programming-for-geoscientists.ipynb)
(Note: you may need to right-click and use *Save Link As...*).

If you are having difficulty opening the file in Anaconda or Canopy then please
revise the guidelines in week 1 or call on one of the GTA's.

This lecture does have quite a bit of material in it. So we are going to
monitor progress closely and may split it across 2 weeks depending on how we
get on.

Update 
------ 
As expected we only got through about half of the material in
this lecture. The rest of the lecture and revision exercises will be covered
next week. Sample solutions for this lecture will also be submitted after next
weeks lecture.
